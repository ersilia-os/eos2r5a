    "Title": "Retrosynthetic accessibility score",
    "Description": "Retrosynthetic accessibility score based on the computer aided synthesis planning tool AiZynthfinder. The authors have selected a ChEMBL subset of 200.000 molecules, and checked whether AiZinthFinder could identify a synthetic route or not. This data has been trained to create a classifier that computes 4500 times faster than the underlying AiZynthFinder. Molecules outside the applicability domain, such as the GBD database, need to be fine tuned to their use case.\n",
